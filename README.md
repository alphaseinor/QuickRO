QuickRO

This is a work in progress... don't trust anything here

Think of this as a high school application, currently not much of anything is here.

Okay, if your 4 year old was writing programs, this is probably worse than that...

you are still reading this?

There are plenty of shrinks out there if you are into this level of sadism.

okay if you insist.

This will be a direct port of QuickRO, an internal application originally designed and implemented in Win32, BeOS API. Both of which will not be used, none of the technology used in them will be used. The appearance will not be used, only some of the workflows that are applicable will be a direct port.

So what the hell is this?

It's a web based version of an invoicing program that has integrated cost based pricing algorithms, inventory management, and a bunch of HR stuff, not sure how it's going to come together, but there will be some WASM, some JS, some JS library, some CSS or SASS, probably a router somewhere... who knows...
